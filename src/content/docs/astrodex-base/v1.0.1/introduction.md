# The Astrodex Engine

**Astrodex** is an elite, open-source documentation framework engineered for technical teams who value speed, minimalism, and developer-centric UX. Built on **Astro 5.x** and **Tailwind CSS v4**, it delivers a "Premium-Dark" aesthetic out of the box.

## Core Philosophies

### 1. Performance Above All
We believe documentation should load faster than the code it describes. Astrodex utilizes **Astro's Island Architecture** to deliver zero-JS by default, ensuring instant availability even on restricted networks.

### 2. Monochromatic Precision
The **Obsidian & Silver** design language is intentional. By stripping away visual clutter and unnecessary color, we ensure the user's cognitive load is focused entirely on your technical content.

### 3. Infinite Scalability
Unlike standard documentation tools, Astrodex is built for **Ecosystems**. It allows you to manage multiple independent projects (e.g., CLI, SDKs, Core API) and their respective versions within a single unified Git repository.

## Technical Stack

- **Framework:** [Astro 5.x](https://astro.build/) (Static Site Generation)
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) (CSS-Variables first)
- **Validation:** [Zod](https://zod.dev/) (Strict type-safety for content)
- **Typography:** Inter (Optimized for technical readability)
