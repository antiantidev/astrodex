# Introduction to Astrodex

**Astrodex** is a premium, open-source documentation starter kit engineered for speed, precision, and absolute clarity. Built with **Astro 5.x** and **Tailwind CSS v4**, it provides a sophisticated, monochromatic foundation for housing multiple projects and versions in one unified hub.

## Why use this Starter Kit?

Documentation is often the most neglected part of a product. Astrodex changes that by providing a "Product-level" UI that feels high-end, responsive, and developer-centric out of the box.

### Key Engine Features

- 🚀 **Extreme Performance:** Near-perfect 100/100 Lighthouse scores. Zero-JS by default ensures content is available instantly.
- 🎨 **Monochromatic Aesthetic:** The **Obsidian & Silver** theme reduces visual noise, keeping the user's focus on the technical content.
- 📂 **Multi-Project Architecture:** Host independent projects (e.g., `api`, `sdk`, `docs`) within a single deployment.
- 🔢 **Native Versioning:** Full support for parallel versions (v1.0, v2.0, legacy) with automatic routing.
- 🔍 **Advanced Navigation:** A dynamic sidebar with real-time filtering, folder-based grouping, and state persistence.

## Technical Foundation

- **[Astro 5.x](https://astro.build/):** Primary framework using the "Island Architecture" for maximum efficiency.
- **[Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/):** For lightning-fast, CSS-first styling and theme management.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/):** Full type safety across the entire codebase.
- **[Zod](https://zod.dev/):** Strict metadata validation to prevent broken links and build errors.
