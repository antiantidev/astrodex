# The Astrodex Manual

Welcome to the official documentation for the **Astrodex Starter Kit**. This project is not just a demo; it's a living example of how to structure a professional, multi-project documentation ecosystem.

### What you will find here:
- **Setup Guide:** How to clone, install, and deploy your own instance.
- **Customization:** How to rebrand the UI, change colors, and modify the home page.
- **Content Management:** Understanding frontmatter, project metadata, and folder-based grouping.
- **Interactive Components:** Using Admonitions, Mermaid diagrams, and code blocks.

> **Tip:** If you are viewing this on the live demo site, you can use the **Sidebar Filter** on the left to quickly jump to specific customization topics.
