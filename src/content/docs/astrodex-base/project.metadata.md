# The Astrodex Protocol

Welcome to the central intelligence hub for the **Astrodex Engine**. This documentation is designed for developers who demand high performance, monochromatic precision, and absolute technical clarity.

### Operational Overview
This manual covers everything from initial bootstrap to advanced multi-project orchestration. Whether you're hosting a single API reference or a massive enterprise ecosystem, Astrodex provides the infrastructure you need.

### Key Knowledge Areas:
- **Core Architecture:** Understanding the static-first, zero-JS philosophy.
- **Ecosystem Management:** Scaling from one project to hundreds within a single hub.
- **Advanced Formatters:** Utilizing Mermaid, MDX, and premium code blocks.
- **SEO & Performance:** Maintaining 100/100 Lighthouse scores and global edge distribution.

> **Technical Note:** This project is a "dogfooding" example. Everything you see here—from the sidebar filtering to the version switcher—is powered by the very engine described in these pages.
