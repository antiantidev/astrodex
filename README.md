## ⚡ Why Astrodex?

Documentation is often the most neglected part of a product. **Astrodex** changes the narrative by treating documentation as a high-end software product. It’s not just a template; it's a static-first engine designed to scale from a single README to a massive enterprise hub.

### 🚀 Core Pillars
- **Infinite Scalability:** Orchestrate multiple independent projects (CLI, API, SDKs) in one unified hub.
- **Native Versioning:** Parallel support for `v1.x`, `v2.x`, and `legacy` with automatic routing.
- **Obsidian Aesthetic:** A premium, monochromatic design system that eliminates visual noise.
- **Search Engine Dominance:** Engineered for SEO with automatic sitemaps, semantic HTML, and metadata validation.

## ✨ Features for Technical Teams

### 📂 Ecosystem Management
Manage independent project identities using the `project.metadata.md` manifest. Each project gets its own overview, maintainer list (Facepile), and version switcher.

### 🔍 Elite Discovery Tools
- **Stateful Sidebar:** Remembers collapsed/expanded groups across sessions.
- **Real-time Filter:** Instant UI refinement as you type.
- **Command Palette:** Site-wide search via `Ctrl + K` with pre-indexed results.

### 📊 Advanced Technical Formatters
- **Mermaid.js Diagrams:** Native architecture and sequence visualization.
- **Premium Code Blocks:** Shiki-powered syntax highlighting with one-click copy.
- **Admonitions:** Semantic callouts for `Note`, `Warning`, and `Danger`.
- **Intelligent Assets:** Automatic WebP conversion and `medium-zoom` lightboxes.
